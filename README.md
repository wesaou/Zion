# Zion
The lightweight personal assistant that you can text!

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* A new gmail, that only Zion will use, as it will read the emails in the inbox, and will get confused by anything else
* A valid phone number, with Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, Metro PCS, or US Cellular as a carrier (only tested with Verizon) to communicate with Zion
* A host machine that is running Linux, with internet access (Raspberry Pi is perfect)

## Installation
To setup Zion:
```
sudo python3 setup.py
```

To Run Zion:
```
sudo python3 Zion.py
```

## About
Zion is my first Github project, and my first python project in general. Feel free to leave feedback, as I have been scripting for about a year, and I am looking for contructive criticism. If this is practical, I hope to see it go somewhere, as I am no where near to close to done with it. I hope to add many new convientient features to it, such as home automation.
